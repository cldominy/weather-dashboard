[Click here to check out the webiste!](https://cldominy.github.io/weather-dashboard/ "Work Day Planner")

This website was built using Bootstrap for styling and Open Weather API to generate current weather predictions based on user input. Users are able to search for any city and the weather is dynamically generated! It displays the current weather and a five-day forecast. Up to 10 cities are saved each time a user searches and can be selected again to display the weather. If refreshed, the searched cities remain on the page, as well as the last searched city's weather information. Future updates include displaying a new picture as the header image based on the current weather and amending the search list so cities do not appear twice.
